      <h3>Educate yourself about the process to eventually playing professionally</h3>
      <p>The paths to become a professional soccer player differ around the world. There’s a great difference in the journey of a professional player in Europe and in the USA for example. By educating yourself about the journey of professional soccer players around the world, you’ll get a better idea of what kinds of elite soccer training your child should be participating in at various stages and ages of their life. Therefore, educating yourself about the process is step one.</p><br>

      <p>Compare the basic paths of professional soccer players in both the USA and Europe below:</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Youth elite soccer player path to playing professionally – USA</strong></p>
      <p>Ages 5 – 9: Join local travel teams with good coaches and good connections.</p>
      <p>Ages 9 – 12: Join your first USSDA team and work hard to become one of the best in your region. Attend soccer camps abroad to broaden your knowledge of the game.</p>
      <p>Ages 12 – 17: Join the FC Barcelona High Performance Soccer Academy in Arizona USA for 1 – 4 years.</p>
      <p>Ages 15 – 18: Connect to college coaches and join college try-outs and trials to gain recognition. Consider training at a High Performance Soccer Academy in Europe for 1 – 4 years to broaden your knowledge of the game.</p>
      <p>Ages 18 – 21: Play at a Division I university with coaches who know how to get into the MLS and have a history of producing professional players. Prepare to be invited to the MLS Combine (make connections with college coaches and MLS coaches). Or prepare to be signed by Generation Adidas to play professionally early and then eventually attend the MLS Superdraft.</p>
      <p>Ages 21 – 22 (perhaps earlier): Attend the MLS Superdraft and get selected to play professionally.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Youth elite soccer player path to playing professionally – Europe</h3>
      <p>Ages 5 – 9: Playing on their local teams or playing for local official youth teams of professional soccer clubs. Attend summer soccer camps affiliated with great club teams to improve their skills.</p>
      <p>Ages 10 – 15: From 10 – 15 years old, players can either continue to play on smaller local youth teams without residences, or they can join larger youth teams at more successful football clubs that have residence options. Read more about youth teams for youth elite soccer players here.</p>
      <p>Ages 13 to 18: Youth elite soccer players have the opportunity to join high performance soccer academies. Although more costly, high performance academies are the safest and best option for students who have the potential to become professional soccer players.</p>
      <p>*Consider joining a high performance academy in the USA to win and soccer scholarship and study and compete at an American university.</p>
      <p>Ages 16 – 21: At the age of 16, players are eligible to sign professional contracts. Football clubs sign professional soccer contracts with players on their youth teams because they believe that they can either play on the club’s first team or because they believe that they can rent or sell these players to other clubs for a decent profit.</p>

      <h3>Send your child to summer soccer camps to encourage their passion and fine-tune their talent</h3>
      <p>Youth elite soccer players from about ages 5 – 12 should be exposed to as much soccer and as many different coaches as possible. This exposure makes them well-rounded and versatile players.</p>
      <p>It’s particularly important that your child is exposed to different coaches. Each coach will likely have a slightly different perspective (sometimes drastically different perspective) about your child’s natural strengths and weaknesses. As a result, each coach might see them prevailing in different positions on the pitch.</p>
      <p>By allowing many coaches to coach your child at a young age, your child will be more likely to try new positions and styles of play. They’ll learn to adapt to the styles of play that their coaches demand as they grow older and join more serious teams.</p>
      <p>Additionally, by being exposed to different positions on the pitch, your child will become a well-rounded player with extensive knowledge about all field positions.</p>
      <p>To ensure that your child is exposed to many different coaches and styles of play at a young age, it’s a great idea to send them to summer soccer camps where they’ll be exposed to different coaches, players, styles of play, styles of coaching, etc.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Finding the balance between receiving an education and training to become a professional soccer player</h3>
      <p>When your child reaches adolescence (around 13 years old), their soccer training becomes more intense. At the same time, their studies become more rigorous.</p>
      <p>It’s extremely important not to dismiss the importance your child’s education. While becoming a professional soccer player would be a dream come true for these children, even the most talented players have a slim shot at becoming professional soccer players.</p>
      <p>Of course it’s important to help your child reach their full potential on the soccer field and, hopefully, help your child become a professional soccer player. But, it’s even more important to make sure that they also receive a top-of-the-line education in case their plans fall through.</p>
